This is part of a tutorial on how to perform pairwise whole-genome comparisons. 
The tutorial contains 4 steps. First step, we retrieve four whole genome sequences from GenBank.
In second step we build local blast databases. Third step, the comparison file is generated. 
In the fourth step we visualize the comparison in ACT (Sanger - Artemis Comparison Tool) and some statistics of the comparison.
The tutorial code and a list of four genomes are provided.
